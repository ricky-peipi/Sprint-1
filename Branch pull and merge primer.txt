What is a main? Well if I am understanding it correctly, a main is the primary area where a project is made. Also a main is also considered the main codebase as when the repo is created it needs a foundation and core code for it to be created and function so it can store files or projects. 

Why would you create a branch? Well one big reason for the creation of a branch is that, it allows users to work on other projects that may be considered sub projects (so not the main project-but still related) without changing teh main codebase. But this doesn't stop them from pushing the other branches updates to the main area.

Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand? When being introduced to it yes. But after reading a bit about the need for something like a branch, it became a much easier concept to understand.
